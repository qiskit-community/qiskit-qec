# Validating fault-tolerant circuits

**Problem**: *Circuits that purportedly measure stabilizers could be checked for correctness* (proposed by Ted Yoder)

**Problem**: *Given a (Clifford) circuit for stabilizer measurements and a code, decide whether the circuit is fault-tolerant (i.e., can d-1 or fewer faults be placed to cause a logical error without triggering any stabilizer or flag measurements)* (proposed by Ted Yoder)

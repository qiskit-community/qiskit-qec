## Automorphism group computation

- Definition of the automorphism groups of subsystem stabilizer codes
- How does the definition differ for subspace and subsystem codes?
- There are several types of automorphism groups so we need to be clear which one(s) we mean
- What can we compute about non-Clifford automorphisms?

**Problem**: *Compute the automorphism group of a subsystem stabilizer code*

- What are the inputs and outputs?
- What algorithms exist?
- What is the computational complexity of this problem?

**Problem**: *Compute the set of single codeblock transversal gates of a subsystem stabilizer code*

- These gates are contained in the automorphism group

---

**Problem**: *Compute the set of gates that can be enacted by qubit permutations*

- These gates are contained in the automorphism group

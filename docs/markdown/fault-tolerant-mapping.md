# Fault-tolerant mapping pass

**Problem**: *Given a purported fault-tolerant circuit and a coupling graph, find a mapping of that circuit onto the coupling graph that preserves the property of being fault-tolerant*

The problem of constructing fault-tolerant quantum gates when there are locality restrictions was considered in these two papers. The first discusses general considerations and the second solves the problem of mapping the Steane code to a two-dimensional lattice of qubits.

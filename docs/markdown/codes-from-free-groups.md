**Problem**: *Finding normal subgroups of the free groups that represent regular lattices on high genus surfaces. This is something one could do in GAP or Magma, but you could go deeper in the QEC direction and return the stabilizer groups for each code, tell you [n,k,d], etc* (proposed by Ted Yoder)

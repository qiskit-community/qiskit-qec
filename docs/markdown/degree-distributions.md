# Degree distribution

**Problem**: *Given a generating set of a gauge group, compute the degree distribution*

Given the Tanner graph of a classical LDPC code, let Lambda_i denote the number of variable nodes of degree i and let P_i denote the number of check nodes of degree i. The polynomials

    Lambda(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{l_max} Lambda_i x^i
    
and

    P(x)=sum_{i=1}^{r_max} P_i x^i
    
are the variable and check *degree distributions from a node perspective*, respectively.

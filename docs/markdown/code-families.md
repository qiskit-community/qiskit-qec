# Constructing families of codes

**Problem**: *Given a set of parameters and a descriptor of a code family, output a "natural" generating set of the gauge group for a member of the family*

- What parameters for each family? What is a natural generating set?
- Need precise definitions throughout

## Examples of families of codes

- Toric codes
- Planar surface codes
- Rotated surface codes
- Triangular surface codes
- Subsystem surface codes
- Rotated subsystem surface codes
- Bacon-Shor codes
- Triangular color codes 6.6.6, 4.8.8, ...
- ...

### Notes

We will need to prioritize these based on what we believe people are most likely to use.

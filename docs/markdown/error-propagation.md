# Faults and error propagation

**Problem**: *Given a Clifford circuit, propagate all single faults to the end. (Scroll through the result in a GUI? Output as a list?) Same with all pairs of faults, or more?* (proposed by Ted Yoder)

**Problem**: *Given a stabilizer circuit, insert faults according to some model and propagate errors to the output qubits and measurements**

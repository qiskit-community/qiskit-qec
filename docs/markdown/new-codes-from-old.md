# Constructing new codes from existing codes

**Problem**: *Given generators for quantum and/or classical codes, construct new quantum codes*

(This is too general)

(We need to be careful about scope. There is already well developed software for constructing classical codes. The focus here should be on constructions of quantum codes. We should assume that computations with classical codes are done by someone else.)

## Examples of constructions

- Product codes
    - Hypergraph product
    - Homological product
    - Distance balancing
- Punctured codes
- Concatenated codes

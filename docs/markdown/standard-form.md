# Standard form computations

**Problem**: *Given gauge/stabilizer generators, put them into a standard form and compute representatives for the gauge and logical Pauli operators*

- Gottesman provides an algorithm to put the generator matrix of a stabilizer code in a particular standard form from which the logical operators of the code can be read.

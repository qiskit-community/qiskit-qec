    "# Using the Union Find decoder in qiskit_qec\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the process of creating a code, inserting errors and running the union find decoder on it using the qiskit_qec framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The union find decoder was first proposed by Nicolas Delfosse and Naomi H. Nickerson in 2020 in *Almost linear time decoding algorithm for topological codes*. The core idea of the algorithm is to take a syndrome and \"convert\" it to an erasure. This erasure can be efficiently decoded by an erasure decoder (e.g. peeling decoder in $O(N)$ time). \n",
    "\n",
    "It works by growing clusters which are started around non-typical vertices in the syndrome graph by one half-edge per step in every direction. When two clusters meet, they merge and are considered one cluster.\n",
    "A cluster grows when it is **odd**, meaning that it contains an odd number atypical nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The set of edges that is fully grown (meaning grown twice in an unweighted implementation) at the point where there are no more odd clusters, is considered to be the erasure and passed on to the erasure decoder. "

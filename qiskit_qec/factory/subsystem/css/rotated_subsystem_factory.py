    """Rotated subsystem surface code (RSSC) code factory.

    The rotated subsystem surace code (RSSC) family consists of codes
    constructed by taking a finite subset weight 3 gauge operators from
    the weight thee operators defined by the infinite tiling given by
    tiling the plane with one of the tiles:

    (Diamond or Rotated orientation)

             o               o
            /X\             /Z\
           o---o           o---o
          /|   |\         /|   |\
         oZ|   |Zo   or  oX|   |Xo
          \|   |/         \|   |/
           o---o           o---o
            \X/             \Z/
             o               o

    where the gauge operators are weight three X and Z type defined
    around the square with X opposite X and Z opposite Z.

    Or equivelently, it may be constructured by one of the rotated tiles:

    (Square or non-Rotated orientation)

        o--o--o          o--o--o
        |X/ \Z|          |X/ \Z|
        o/   \o     or   o/   \o
        |\   /|          |\   /|
        |Z\ /X|          |Z\ /X|
        o--o--o          o--o--o


    Qubits are located on the lattice Z^2 and each qubit is assigned the
    natural coordinate associated with the Z^2 lattice.

    The tile orientation passed to the code factory as a specification.

    factory = RSSCCodeFactory(...)
    factory.set_spec(orientation=...)

    where orientation is one of (diamond or rotated) or (square or non-rotated). The default is
    rotated.

    Internal computations are done in the non-rotated tiling as the tiles are located

    Selection of the subtiling

    The shape of the subtiling:

    One approach to selecting a subtiling is to provide a bounding shape from which
    the subtiling is cut from the full tiling (we assume that the subtiling is finite and
    so the inside of the shape is choosen for the subtiling where the inside of the shape is
    defined as the region with finite area/volume)

    The shape is encoded in a Shape class. We assume that the shape and the full latiice live
    on the same manifold.

    The selection of the subtiling defining the code can be made in various ways:

        1) Setting the distance d. This will assume that the shape of the subtiling is
        "square", select type is "Intersect" with k=2. A boundary may alos be provided.

        factory.set_spec(d=d, shape="square", k=2,...)

        2) Setting a shape. Gauge operators and their quibts within the bounds of the (closed)
        shape are included. Those gauge opertors and their qubits that are not strictly bounded
        by the provided shape are included (perhaps partially) according to the select style
        choosen:

            "Cut" : Only gauge opertors and there qubits that are fully bounded by the shape
                    are included
            "Intersect" : Include gauge operators and their qubits that have at least k of those
                     qubits bounded by the shape. Some gauge operators may
                     have reduced weight as some of their qubits may not meet the selection
                     critera
            "Other" : Any other selection method that is possible to choose the operators.

        factory.set_spec(shape = shape, select=<select_type>, k= ...)

    The X and Z gauge operator lists are given as lists of supports.
    There is a consistent qubit ordering of these lists so that
    other modules can construct gate schedules for circuits.

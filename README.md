**Qiskit Framework for Qauntum Error Correction** is an open-source framework for developers, experimentalist and theorists of Quantum Error Correction (QEC). The framework is in the development stage.

## Contributing 

Contributors to the framework are welcome. The following describes how the framework is being designed and built. The current approach is designed to enable a wide range of disciplines to contibute earlier and to enable better computer engineering earlier on. This approach has a development process and a scope control. The Development porcess is based on increasing details of requirements and code details. The basic process is outlined in the following figure:

QEC requirments, both general and specific, are first written down. Each requirement must then me given a detailed precise mathematical descripition. These descriptions are then use to develop various soluton appoaches and associated pseudo code. From here prototype code is developed. Once the code has been tested and fits within the agreed upon architectural framework is becomes framework code. A similar process occurs for the architectural side of the project.

Scope control is used initially to establish a good foundation.  The basic process is outlined in the following figure:

![Scope Control](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-qec/blob/develop/docs/images/ScopeControlv1.png?raw=true "Scope Control")

Scope control is done by prioritizing which requirements get worked on first. The priorities are determined by selected core QEC or architecure requirements or via requirements required by a few selected projects.

## Major Projects

There are currently two different major projects to develop the QEC framework. The first is the core CLI/API framework and the second is the visual code GUI.

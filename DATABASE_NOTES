Important Notes:

Only the Standard Codebase (qec_standard_subsystem_codebase, currently located in https://github.ibm.com/Grace-Harper/ibm-codebase-repo/ )
is considered verified. Nothing in playground is verified.

The Standard Codebase is *NOT* complete. If you query for some n,k code and receive fewer results
than you expect (including no results at all), this is likely due to the those codes missing from the codebase.


Incomplete properties for
[[9,2]] - only computed css, tri, and gf4linear for d=3
[[9,3]] - only computed css, tri, and gf4linear for d=3
[[9,4]] - did not compute css or gf4linear
[[10,0]]
[[10,1]]
[[10,6]]
